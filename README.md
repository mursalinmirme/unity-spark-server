## What does our server do?

Unity Spark's server side is the backbone of our Human Resource Management system. It handles data management, authentication, and ensures seamless communication between our web application and the database. This robust server is built with technologies like Mongoose, Express, JWT, Cors, and Dotenv, working in harmony to deliver a secure and efficient experience.

## Why these technologies?

We carefully selected Mongoose for MongoDB interaction, Express for building a robust API, JWT for secure user authentication, Cors for handling cross-origin requests, and Dotenv for managing environment variables. Each choice contributes to a smooth and secure server-side operation.

## Challenges Faced and Future Features:

Our journey with Unity Spark's server side has been filled with challenges that propelled our growth. Looking ahead, we plan to enhance user authentication, implement advanced security features, and continually refine the server for optimal performance.
